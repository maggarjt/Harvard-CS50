# quick sketch of program

counts top votes
#if noone has > 50% then

#    drop lowest candidate or candidates if they tie lowest vote count
#    (found by iteration of list of candidate structs)

#for all structs with lowest candidate as their first
 #   check their next index [i +1] and add that name or add to count

   # recheck vote counts by iterating through candidate structs
        # keep checking for >50


      # if all candidates get zero votes then output a Tie


    #possibly make voter structs? holding the candidate names?
    #iterating via zero'th [i] and then checking adding [i+1]
    #and add to a counter



   **** assuming all voters enter all candidates in their vote
    do not worry about voter writing 2/5 names

    possible bool for elimination?
